**(Canvas Designer)[http://muaz-khan.github.com/Everything/Canvas/Tools/Designer/]:** - (Canvas Designer)[http://muaz-khan.github.com/Everything/Canvas/Tools/Designer/] is a drawing tool for [Canvas 2d API](http://www.w3c.org/TR/2dcontext/) users! It helps you draw many shapes and also auto-generates [2D API](http://www.w3c.org/TR/2dcontext/) relevant code in absolute or relative formats! In simple words, it gives you a designing surface where you can design simple-to-complex shapes using a built-in (IDE)[http://muaz-khan.github.com/Everything/Canvas/Tools/Designer/]!
